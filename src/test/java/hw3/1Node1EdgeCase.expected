# Tests that a graph can be created, one node and edge can be added
# and one node and edge can be printed.

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add one nodes
added node n1 to graph1

# Add an edge
added edge e1 from n1 to n1 in graph1

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from n1
graph1 contains: n1
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n1(e1)
