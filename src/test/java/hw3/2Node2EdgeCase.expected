# Tests that a graph can be created, two nodes and two edges can be added
# and both nodes and edges can be printed.

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add two nodes
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1

# Add two edges
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge e2 from n2 to n1 in graph1

# Print the outgoing edges from n1 and n2
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n2(e1)
the children of n2 in graph1 are: n1(e2)
