I added a method to my model to allow the hw10 to properly get the information needed for finding path.
I added a method to my model to allow the hw10 to get individual coordinates for the building selections.

a.
Buttons are controllers, fetches are model, and the map itself are views. Each one should be separated in into it's own
general method.

b.
I had to create more methods to specialize to give the proper format to be parsed by the javascript.

c.
I created a method to fetch the path and a method to fetch the individual buildings. This was done to split up
unrelated tasks.

d.
None.
