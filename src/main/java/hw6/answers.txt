Briefly describe any changes made to your Graph ADT from HW 3-4 and why
those changes were made below.  (See the HW6 assignment for details.)

Fixed GraphEdge equals to properly test edges and not nodes.
Changed Node and Edge implementation to utilize treeset instead of hashset.
Changed Node and graph get nodes/edges methods to construct a new set and passing in the current set.
Changed Node and Edge add method to check not add if edge/node is already present to keep uniqueness.
Changed Graph equals so it compares nodes and edges.
Changed Graph checkrep to check if there are null nodes
Changed Graph, GraphNode, GraphEdges hashcode to utilize Objects.hash
Added a get method to Graph and GraphNode to more easily access objects
Added compareto for treeset for graph and nodes so they can implement comparable
