Problem 6.

(a)
It failed because there was a <= when comparing to 0, which made the program think that 0 was negative.

(b)
It failed because there was a <= when compared to 2, which made the program set 2 to 1 instead of just returning 2.

(c)
It failed because there was a - sign instead of a + so it was subtracting the two previous digits instead of adding
them as the fibonacci sequence is supposed to.

Problem 7. 

I replaced volume=volume with this.volume = volume in order to clarify to the system what was being assigned where,
I also did the same for the getvolume method.
