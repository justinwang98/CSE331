Problem 6.

(a)
It failed because there was a <= when comparing to 0, which made the program think that 0 was negative.

(b)
It failed because there was a <= when compared to 2, which made the program set 2 to 1 instead of just returning 2.

(c)
It failed because there was a - sign instead of a + so it was subtracting the two previous digits instead of adding
them as the fibonacci sequence is supposed to.

Problem 7. 

I replaced volume=volume with this.volume = volume in order to clarify to the system what was being assigned where,
I also did the same for the getvolume method.
One way you can implement getballsfromsmallest() is to make a comparator and use collections.sort in order to sort the balls.
So that you sort in the function.
Another way is to presort whenever you add a ball into the box, that way the function simply returns the already sorted collection.
I think the better way is to use the comparator to sort all at once when you call the method unless you need the set to be sorted all the time
since sorting is expensive.
